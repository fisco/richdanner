            <p>Sadly, I have to work for a living, but we all do. Fortunately, I actually work at something else I have
                a passion for&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and that’s food! I trained as a classical pastry chef. I externed at a
                resort where the Executive Chef, Jim Freeman, cross-trained me as a general purpose chef while I was
                also training as a pastry chef. Which was a very good thing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;finding work as a pastry
                chef is extremely difficult because everyone buys their pastry off the truck these days and I would have
                been a starving chef!</p>

            <p>My ultimate goal as a chef would have been to operate a boulangerie. I love baking bread. But in the
                States that’s a hard dream to realize because again, there are very few places that could support a
                boulangerie sucessfully.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to retire as a chef simply because the industry has changed for the worse. Thanks to the
                Food
                Network, everyone has an unrealistic idea of what any food should be. If it’s not jumping off the plate
                with
                fireworks singing “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” most folk think it's bad product and will complain horribly
                when in
                reality, a boiled egg, for example, is a boiled egg and nothing more. That’s not for me and believe me,
                I’ve
                heard it all. I’ve had people ask me to provide catering service for 74 cents per person when they had a
                corporate department allowance in excess of $25,000.00 a year, people who returned a half eaten cake
                complaining
                that it was not sweet enough because it was made with an Italian Meringue buttercream and not an
                American high
                ratio shortening to icing, and most recently&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the frosting was too white(?)</p>

            <p>I have a passion for food, yes and I love being a chef. Unfortunately, its next to impossible these days
                just to clock in, do your job to the best of your ability, and clock out. There’s too much drama in the
                kitchen for this llama so I will plan for something else when it’s time.</p>
