    <h1>What I do to pay the bills&#8230;</h1>

    <p>Sadly, I have to work for a living, but we all do. Fortunately, I actually work at something else I have a passion for&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and that’s food! I trained as a classical pastry chef. I externed at a resort where the Executive Chef, Jim Freeman, cross-trained me as a general purpose chef while I was also training as a pastry chef. Which was a very good thing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;finding work as a pastry chef is extremely difficult because everyone buys their pastry off the truck these days and I would have been a starving chef!</p>

    <p>My ultimate goal as a chef would have been to operate a boulangerie. I love baking bread. But in the States that’s a hard dream to realize because again, there are very few places that could support a boulangerie sucessfully.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to retire as a chef simply because the industry has changed for the worse. Thanks to the Food
        Network, everyone has an unrealistic idea of what any food should be. If it’s not jumping off the plate with
        fireworks singing “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” most folk think it's bad product and will complain horribly when in
        reality, a boiled egg, for example, is a boiled egg and nothing more. That’s not for me and believe me, I’ve
        heard it all. I’ve had people ask me to provide catering service for 74 cents per person when they had a
        corporate department allowance in excess of $25,000.00 a year, people who returned a half eaten cake complaining
        that it was not sweet enough because it was made with an Italian Meringue buttercream and not an American high
        ratio shortening to icing, and most recently&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the frosting was too white(?)</p>

    <p>I have a passion for food, yes and I love being a chef. Unfortunately, its next to impossible these days just to clock in, do your job to the best of your ability, and clock out. There’s too much drama in the kitchen for this llama so I will plan for something else when it’s time.</p>
