            <p>Although I consider myself a jack of all trades and a master of none, I am at heart an artist. As I am
                also at that time in life when I need to think about retirement, I have decided that my retirement will
                be in quilting. I am undecided if I want to take the plunge and start a long arm quilting business or
                just stick with designing and executing my own original creations. Maybe a blend of both? I am only just
                in the planning stages now.</p>

                <p>What inspires me? Definitely nature&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;primarily the color and amusement of nature. I
                    am also an avid gardener with deep roots in the rich soil of the Pennsylvania farmland of my birth.
                    I am also drawn to the classical and neo-classical world of Western Europe&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;order,
                    composition, harmony, structure; the transcendentals of Beauty, Goodness, and Truth.</p>

                <p>But I also like the element of surprise and unexpected delight. There is a delicious word in Italian
                    that defies
                    easy translation&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<i>sprezzatori</i>. It's best understood as something not
                    necessary but essential
                    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;a little touch of surprise to delight the senses. An example? Led Zeppelin’s “<a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uviy-st2acA">Fool in the Rain</a>” from 1979’s <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Through_the_Out_Door"><i>In Through the Out Door</i></a>.
                    Yes,
                    many say its Led Zeppelin’s worst song and a sellout to disco, but in reality it’s one of their most
                    brilliant simply because it defies convention. When the whistle hits at the end of the second minute
                    and
                    everything collides into a wild bossa nova beat&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;that’s pure musical
                    genius&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;an unexpected
                    surprise&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<i>a sprezzatori!</i> That’s me and my approach to quilt design.</p>
